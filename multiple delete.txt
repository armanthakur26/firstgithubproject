multiple delete

This code is an asynchronous JavaScript function that appears to be a part of a React component, used for deleting selected shipments from a list. It uses Axios to make HTTP requests to a local API. Let's break down the code line by line:

1. `deletemultiple = async () => {`: This line defines an asynchronous function named `deletemultiple`.

2. `const { shipments } = this.state;`: This line destructures the `shipments` property from the component's state. It assumes that the component has a state object with a `shipments` property.

3. `const checkedIds = shipments.filter((shipment) => shipment.ischecked).map((shipment) => shipment.id);`: Here, it filters the `shipments` array to find shipments that have the `ischecked` property set to `true`. It then creates an array of IDs by using `map` on the filtered shipments.

4. The code enters a try-catch block to handle errors that might occur during the deletion process.

5. `for (const id of checkedIds) {`: It starts a loop to go through each checked shipment ID.

6. `await axios.delete(`https://localhost:7225/api/Shipment?id=${id}`);`: Inside the loop, it uses Axios to send an HTTP DELETE request to a URL constructed with the `id` of the shipment. This presumably deletes the selected shipment on the server.

7. `this.setState((prevState) => ({` and the subsequent lines update the state. It removes the deleted shipments from the `shipments` array using the `filter` method. It checks if each shipment's `id` is not in the `checkedIds` array, effectively excluding the deleted shipments.

8. `} catch (error) {`: If an error occurs during the deletion process, it enters the catch block.

9. `console.error("Error deleting shipments:", error);`: Within the catch block, it logs an error message to the console, including the error that occurred during the deletion process.

In summary, this code is for deleting multiple shipments based on a list of checked shipments. It iterates through the checked shipments, sends DELETE requests to the server for each one, updates the component's state to reflect the removal of deleted shipments, and handles errors by logging them to the console.
