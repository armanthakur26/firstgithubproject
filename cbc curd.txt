import React, { Component } from 'react';
This line imports the React object and the Component class from the react package. It is a common practice to import these in React components because they are used to create and manage components.

jsx
Copy code
export class Classbc extends Component {
This line declares a class component named Classbc that extends the Component class from React. The export keyword makes this class accessible for importing into other modules.

jsx
Copy code
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      tasks: [],
      newTask: '',
      editingTaskId: null,
    };
  }
Here's what's happening within the constructor:

constructor(props): The constructor is a special method that's called when an instance of the class is created. It takes in props as an argument.
super(props): Calls the constructor of the parent class (Component). It's important to call super(props) to make sure the parent class's constructor is properly initialized.
this.state = { ... }: Initializes the component's state with an empty array for tasks, an empty string for newTask, and editingTaskId set to null.
jsx
Copy code
  handleInputChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ newTask: e.target.value });
  };
This line defines an arrow function named handleInputChange. It takes an event object e as a parameter. Inside the function, it uses this.setState to update the newTask property in the component's state with the value entered in the input field.

jsx
Copy code
  add = () => {
    const { tasks, newTask } = this.state;

    if (newTask.trim() === '') {
      return;
    }

    const newTaskObject = {
      id: Date.now(),
      name: newTask,
    };

    const updatedTasks = [...tasks, newTaskObject];
    this.setState({
      tasks: updatedTasks,
      newTask: '',
    });
  };
Here's what happens in the add function:

It extracts tasks and newTask from the component's state.
It checks if newTask is not just whitespace. If it's empty or contains only spaces, it returns early.
It creates a new task object with a unique ID (using Date.now()) and the name provided in newTask.
It creates a new array updatedTasks by combining the existing tasks with the new task object.
It updates the state with the new array of tasks and clears the newTask input.
